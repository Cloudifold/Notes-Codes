    \section{Type Theories}

    \begin{defn}
        A \textbf{typing declaration} is \textit{symbols} of form $x : A$,\\
        we say that $x$ is a \textbf{term} (of type $A$) and $A$ is the \textbf{type}.\\
        A \textbf{context} is a \textit{list of typing declarations} in which each term is different symbol\\
        A \textbf{judgment} is symbols of the form $\Gamma \vdash W$ where $\Gamma$ is a \textit{context}.
        A \textbf{rule} asserts that if some given \textit{list of judgments} are valid,
        then so is another one of a specified form derived from them. 
    \end{defn}
    
    \begin{defn}
        A \textbf{Type Theory} is determined by its collections of \textit{types, judgments, and rules}.\\
        And A \textbf{Type Theory} must have following rules:\\
